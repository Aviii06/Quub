# Quub

The game is a 2.5D adventure game where the user clears multiple levels to reach the final button/flag. The idea is similar to Ninja Warrior or Takeshi's castle. 
The levels are parkour games, and the element of "Duality" is introduced in the way of changing the direction of gravity on changing the wall sides.
The game makes heavy use of wall sides to implement the theme.
